Ghost riders in the sky
==========================

An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie I oh oh oh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught em yet
Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire as they ride on hear their cries

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
'If you wanna save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Yippie I oh oh oh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky 

Cocaine
===============

You take Sally and I'll take Sue
Their ain't no difference between the two
Cocaine, running all 'round my brain

Headin' down Scott, turnin' up Main
Looking for that girl that sells cocaine
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain

Late last night about a quarter past four
Ladanyi come knockin' down my hotel room door
Where's the cocaine...
It's runnin' all 'round my brain

I was talking to my doctor down at the hospital
He said, "Son, it says here you're twenty-seven,
But that's impossible
Cocaine... you look like you could be forty-five"

Now I'm losing touch with reality and I'm almost out of blow
It's such a fine line... I hate to see it go
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain

There's a man goin' 'round
===============================================

:: 

   C/G
   There's a man goin' 'round takin' names. 
   An' he decides who to free and who to blame. 
   Everybody won't be treated all the same.

   There'll be a golden ladder reaching down. When the man comes around. 
   C/G
   The hairs on your arm will stand up. 

   At the terror in each sip and in each sup. 

   For you partake of that last offered cup, 
                                    Am
   Or disappear into the potter's ground. 
      F     G              C
   When the man comes around.

   Till Armageddon, no Shalam, no Shalom. 
   Then the father hen will call his chickens home. 
   The wise men will bow down before the throne. 
                                             Am
   And at his feet they'll cast their golden crown. 
      F     G            C/G 
   When the man comes around. 

   Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still. 

   Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still. 

   Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still. 
                                    Am
   Listen to the words long written down, 
      F     G              C
   When the man comes around.

   szaladjon kifelé belőlem gondoltam egyetlen
               G
   nem vagy itt jó helyen
               D
   nem vagy való nekem

   ez tényleg szerelem

               G
   Látom, hogy elsuhan
            D
   felettem egy madár
   Em
   tátongó szívében szögesdrót

   Vágtatnék tovább veled az éjben
      C                   F7
   Az álmok foltos indián lován
   H7                            Em
   Egy táltos szív remeg a konyhakésben

   otthonom kőpokol
            G
   szilánkos mennyország
            D
   folyékony torztükör
            C        Am           G          D
   szentjánosbogarak      fényében tündököl

   Egy indián lidérc kísért itt bennem
   C                      F7
   Szemhéjain rozsdás szemfedő
   H7                         Em
   A tükrökön túl fenn a fellegekben
   C                     D 
   Furulyáját elejti egy angyalszárnyú kígyóbűvölő.


Freaks and Hairies

Em G Am C B7

:: 

   Everywhere is freaks and hairies
   Dykes and fairies, tell me where is sanity
   Tax the rich, feed the poor
   Till there are no rich no more?

   I'd love to change the world
   But I don't know what to do
   So I'll leave it up to you

   Population keeps on breeding
   Nation bleeding, still more feeding economy
   Life is funny, skies are sunny
   Bees make honey, who needs money, Monopoly

   I'd love to change the world
   But I don't know what to do
   So I'll leave it up to you
