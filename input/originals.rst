    I’m getting older every day
    I’m not the first to have every passed that way
    I wear bottle bottom glasses, like Mr. Magoo
    My hair’s receding and my forehead is peaking through

    There’s nothing much we can do
    But with each other we will both pull through

    My knees are knocking and I’m feeling bad
    I’m beginning to look just like my dad
    Please let me rock here in my rocking chair
    Is Lawrence Welk still on the air? 

    There’s nothing much we can do
    But with each other we will both pull through

    My ears are ailing won't you please speak up
    Pour a little more Geritol into my cup
    My doctor recommends Preparation H
    You’ve got to eat more fiber when you reach my age

    There’s nothing much we can do
    But with each other we will both pull through

    Sheep in the meadow
    Cows in the corn
    Little boy blue
    Is blowing his horn
    He’s blowing 12 bars of those blues
    Scat. . . . 
    A good woman is something I think he could use. 

    Little Bo Peep
    Lost all her sheep
    Doesn’t know where she can find them. 
    Sits in the field every night all alone
    Ungrateful sheep ran away from their home
    A good man
    Is something I think she could use

    Jack used to be nimble
    He used to be quick
    Now he just sits by his cold candlestick
    He’s feeling bad, feelin sad, thinkin about a woman he had
    Gotta get a little flick in his Bic put a little kick back in his shoes
    A good woman he could use

    There is an old woman
    Lives in a shoe
    Has so many children doesn’t know what to do
    Too many chores to do too many clothes to wash
    Too much and too little got not time for herself
    A good man, with two good hands 
    She could use

    Well little boy blue met little bo peep
    Blew on his horn and called in her sheep
    Then the old woman, she took in poor Jack
    Together they gonna make a good home 
    Out of that shoe shack
    Got one another gonna help each other
    Got each other gonna help one another pull through
    That’s the best they can do.

    When I get older,
    If I live that long. 
    When I play some music,
    If I learn that song. 
    When I have enough,
    If I know when. 
    When I am at peace, 
    If the war ends. 

    Big red rooster
    Sings a morning song
    Seems a long way to the end
    But in the end it’s not that long

    Redwing blackbird 
    Sitting in the sun
    Dream about tomorrow 
    When the day is done

    When my ship comes in, 
    If it doesn’t sink. 
    When I make my mind up,
    If I start to think. 
    When I’m finally Here and Now
    If I stop and Be
    When I cross the desert
    If the mirage calls out to me

    Little black cricket
    Tunes his violin
    Time enough for winter
    When the summer ends

    Old man dreams of summer
    Dreams both wide and large
    Time enough to make them real 
    Or just mirage

    Crossing the desert of if and when

    When my ship comes in, 
    If it doesn’t sink. 
    When I make up my mind,
    If I start to think. 

    When I win the slots, 
    If I start to play.
    When I tell you everything
    If I start to say. 

    Your feet fall on shifting dune 
    Keep up the search you vow
    Wondering and watching moon
    The oasis of now. 

    When I get well,
    If I don’t get sick. 
    When I learn the game,
    If I pick up the stick.

    When I get older,
    If I live that long. 
    When I play some music,
    If I learn that song. 

    An arid wind, hopes and dreams
    Wander in future spaces
    Mirage is just ahead it seems
    Now is the best oasis

    When I have enough,
    If I know when. 
    When I am at peace, 
    If the war ends. 

    The desert leaves you desperate
    Hourglass of falling sand.
    The oasis of now is there
    In the palm of your hand.

    Dream about tomorrow 
    Until the day is done

    Little black cricket

    A young man sails on the sea
    His dreams as deep, as the sea is wide
    And the waves hit the rocks

    An old man sits by the sea
    His dreams sit by his side

    And the wind, sighed


Past Lives
===================

:: 

    Am intro 
    Am G F E

    Another morning, cup of coffee, and a desk 
    Here's a day with some work and some rest
    There's a week with two days at the end 
    Those are my friends

    there's a month, and a month, and another
    there's a year and it's quite like the others
    there's a life I have lived I am sure 
    cause I was there

    and when I sleep I am sleeping and I'm dreaming
    and my dreams they are dreaming that they're waking
    and my dreams while waking they're waiting
    For me there  (for me to wake)

    Maybe in a past life, I was a captain of a ship
    Last of a breed who ever dared to make a trip across the sea
    And if my fame and fortune lies in the wind and the wave, 
    Then I will be strong and brave
    For the sea it is my god

I'd Walk a mile
=======================

2x D Em/7 F#m Bm with A turnaround 

:: 

    Many years have passed
    Your door was open
    Evening glances
    I have not forgotten

    I'd walk a mile 
    For your wild forest blackberry smile
    I'd stay a while 
    In your garden

    The devil tosses his coin 
    One side ice and one side fire
    Win or lose it's hard to choose 
    between the fear and our desire

    I'd walk a mile 
    For your wild forest blackberry smile
    I'd stay a while 
    In your garden

    Many years have passed
    Your door was open
    Taking chances
    I have not forgotten

When I walked into the wilderness
=========================================

:: 

    Am Am(F# bass)
    Em chorus (like Never Gone Leave You) with Em jam fading to Am. 

    When I walked into the wilderness
    I didn’t know what I would find
    But in the brilliant darkness
    I saw something that was mine. 

    Might be Job or Lazarus
    Might be the prodigal son
    Jesus is a possibility
    But I won’t know until the living’s done

    Chorus
    Not something I can see
    Just something I can feel
    Like the dark side of the moon
    I know that it is real. 

    Long road to Heaven
    Short road to Hell
    One or the other is a given
    Which is which--hard to tell 

    Short road from there to here
    But it's a long, hard way
    I stopped in for a visit once, 
    But I could not stay 

    Chorus


Civilized Restroom Rules
=================================

:: 

    Blues in GM with a am7 bm7 bflatm7 am7 walk up to the V chord
    Intro: use 7come11 G progression

    There is a delicate matter that I’d like to touch upon
    Concerning appropriate behavior in the John. 
    Mother says “don’t touch, you’ll get hair on your knuckles” 
    But you’ll be find if you know these rules when you undo your belt buckle

    I’m a citizen, for civilized restroom rules

    Now concernin this private business, you mind urine and I’ll mind mine
    And don’t forget that holding my own ain’t a crime
    I’m sure that mine is similar, to yours in shape and hue
    and Mine can probably do anything that yours can do. 

    I’m a citizen (and you should be too), for civilized restroom rules. 

    Chorus (with stops)

    It’s hard bein human you can’t whip it out and go,
    And just to do your duty there’s a lot of rules you should know. 
    Now if I was a caveman, you know what I’d do: 
    I’d forget about what people think and throw away the rules. 

    Until then, I’m a citizen, for civilized restroom rules

    Now one man hates another’s kinky sexual preference
    Another hates the jews and lists Hitler as a reference
    A third can’t stand, the African man
    You got to admit there’s a lot of shit on the wall of the public can. 

    I’m a citizen, for civilized restroom rules

    Now men slink into the John,  and space themselves apart
    Carefully looking straight ahead, shake it once and do not fart. 
    I have no clue what women do in their room so pink and purty
    But I’m sure there’s camaraderie and the floor is never dirty. 

    Chorus

If I was Noah
=================================

:: 

   12 bar blues in E
   5/4 intro, 3 / 4 song

    If I was Noah I'd build you a Ark
    Sail On the Ocean till way after Dark
    Of all the species I'd put in two
    Including one of me, including one of me and you.

    If I was Moses I'd part the Red Sea
    Talk to a burning bush, set the people free.
    There isn't anything I couldn't be.
    I'd be anything, I'd be anything for you.

    Bridge?
    If I believed in the bible
    I’d have a revival

    If I was Jesus, I’d wear thorns on my head.
    Carry your cross, and rise from the dead.
    There isn't anything I wouldn't do.
    I’d do anything, I’d do anything for you.

    Repeat the first verse.

Zeus Blues
=================================

E blues

:: 

    Poor old Zeus sitting on the hill
    Women will not love them but the old Goose will
    He's gonna get loose, he's gonna get loose with a goose.
    Just lonely man, and he's got a plan
    If he can't get it the way he wants, he’s gonna get it the way he can.

    Nebuchadnezzar had a beautiful queen
    He tried to please her, but she was a little too mean.
    Now he's down with the eunuchs peeking under their tunics
    Doing that.....
    Just lonely man, and he's got a plan
    If he can't get it the way he wants, he’s gonna get it the way he can.

    Poor old Samson, in love with Delilah
    She's a real schemer going to try to put one by ya
    but he doesn't care but he doesn't care, so he's going to let her cut his hair.
    Just lonely man, and he's got a plan
    If he can't get it the way he wants, he’s gonna get it the way he can.

    Poor old Beezelbub hasn't had a date in years.
    Sitting in the local pub crying in his beer.
    He may be big. He may be dumb. But he needs love like anyone.
    Just lonely man, and he's got a plan
    If he can't get it the way he wants, he’s gonna get it the way he can.

    Poor old me. In love with Madonna
    I would like to call her up and tell her that I wanna
    Get a little kinky. She can hold my slinky
    Doin that. . . . 
    Just lonely man, and he's got a plan
    If he can't get it the way he wants, he’s gonna get it the way he can.

Big bad Chief
=================================

Am E

:: 

    Have you heard the story about the chief?
    His fellow tribesmen just can't get relief.
    He's got a big stone throne, a fine Grass Hut
    He's yelling at his slaves while sitting on his butt.

    Big bad chief sitting on a big Stone throne 
    yelling at his slaves while gnawing on a bone.
    Chief says “build me another big grass home,
    I'm tired of this old one that I already own.”

    Interlude: 
    grass weed stoned buzz high joint

    Well they made his palace great again

    A tower of the finest weed, xxx golden stairs
    With the finest weed xxx, and ivory stairs 
                   and orange tapestries
                   to match his orange hair


    Now one day the chief, he was holding Court 
    Up stepped a man big and mouth but body short
    He said “Hey chief from my field of grass you toke it.
    You built the Great Big House of grass, but I was going to smoke it.

    E, F, G
    I'm getting tired of your shenanigans
    Here's a little curse for you so you won't do it again.

    Well Mr. Short got shorter cuz the chief cut off his head.
    But upon his throne of stone that cursing man had bled.
    Chief says “I cannot use this block of rock no more.
    Up in the attic this stone thrown you must store.”

    So they made him another throne of stone.
    Brought him seven virgins and another gnawin bone.
    The chief was rocking but his people they were bummed.
    Seven virgins down the drain and he didn't save a single one.

    Then from up above came a mighty creak and groan.
    Down from the attic came two tons of crashing Stone.
    Two tons of stone landed on his head
    One minute the chief was rocking, and the next minute he was dead.

    Well the moral of the story in case you can't deduce it
    Is if you have some power you had better not abuse it
    Don't Bogart all the best grass when building a home
    And if you live in the grass house you should never stow a throne.

monologue
=========================


Hercules
Achilles

I was going to call these my “mythological songs”, but that would be illogical because these are real songs. Ideally, I’d start with a monologue about enlightenment or something cool like that. . . but I’m not “enlightened”, and I’m not even sure I believe in the kind of blinding light epiphany where you jump up and yell “Eureka!”. The one time I saw the light it was quickly turned off. I’m the guy who accidentally made it up the mountain, met the master, heard the koan, and headed out the cave door and back down the hill.  I’m more of a believer in a continuum of consciousness. The problem is you can’t go from Here to There. It’s a Be Here Now thing. How hard can that be? It’s not a long trip, unless you do the Zeno’s arrow thing: Get half way there today. Cut the distance in half tomorrow. . . .That’s me. Edging ever closer but probably just too afraid to Be Here. I must be Zenophobic. I know I'm Xylophobic, because xylophones scare the hell out of me. Think about it. .  . Do caves even have doors?

God invented Koans about the same time he—and I say “he” for those who think there’s some big guy sitting on a golden throne while watching naked angels dance and stroking his long . . . beard. . . I think that’s as likely as a chubby, no-nothing super tweeter with orange hair becoming president. . .  Well anyway, after creating mind-exploding brain puzzles God invented apple trees and snakes. Then she invented Beer. And Sex. And Pepper. I really like pepper. 


Angel music



Twilight Zone
If not, I can give up on my Here and Now Koan and invent Apple Flavored Pepper, become rich, and then buy my own stairway to heaven or just hurdle myself through the eye of a needle before I get too fat. Money is power. With enough of it I could buy my own throne, naked angels, and an orange wig.
